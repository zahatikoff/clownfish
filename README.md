# Clownfish

Clownfish one day will be a free and open source, modular Twitch bot written in
Elixir.

## Warning

- So far this repo is nothing but a template.
- The bot is primarily intended to work with twitch,but i hopefully can make it
modular enough to allow for ecosystem of plugins, with which one might be able 
to adapt the core for any other chat application
